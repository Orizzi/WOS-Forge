## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use DOCUMENTATION_INDEX.md as your starting point**
   - When you have a question, open that file first
   - It tells you which other document to read

2. **Keep MAINTENANCE.md handy**
   - Has copy-paste examples for common changes
   - Most modifications will be covered there

3. **Use PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md for finding code**
   - "Where Do I Find X?" table is super useful
   - Reference it before diving into files

4. **Read script.js comments when confused**
   - Every major function is documented
   - Explains what it does, how it works, parameters

5. **Hard refresh browser after changes**
   - Ctrl+Shift+R to clear cache
   - Otherwise you'll see old version

6. **Test one change at a time**
   - Makes it easier to find problems
   - Makes it easier to undo if needed

7. **Use browser DevTools (F12) to debug**
   - Console shows error messages
   - Inspect Elements to see what's happening

## 🆘 If Something Goes Wrong

### "I made a mistake and don't know how to fix it"
→ Check: MAINTENANCE.md → "Fix Common Problems"

### "I changed something and it doesn't work"
→ Check: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md → "Common Mistakes"

### "Colors/Styles broke"
→ Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R
→ Check: Did you save the file?

### "Profiles won't save"
→ Check: Are you using `http://` not `file://`?
→ Run: `python -m http.server 8080`

### "Calculations are wrong"
→ Check: Did you update the `costs` object correctly?

### "Can't find the code I need to edit"
→ Use: PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md → "Where Do I Find X?"
