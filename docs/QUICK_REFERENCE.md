## 💡 Key Concepts

### The Calculator Works Like This:
1. User opens `charms.html`
2. User selects charm levels (FROM and TO)
3. JavaScript reads these values
4. Calculates total resources needed
5. Shows results in a table
6. User can save/load profiles or sort table

### Files You'll Edit Most Often:
- **`style.css`** - To change colors and styling
- **`Scripts/calculator.js`** - To change calculations or add features
- **`charms.html`** - To add new charm types or sections

### You Won't Need to Edit:
- `index.html` - Unless you want to change home page
- `package.json` - Only for npm configuration
- `.stylelintrc.json` - Only for linter rules
